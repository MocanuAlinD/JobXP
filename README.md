# JobXP
App created to track my daily jobs and expenses.

Created using Python, Kivy, KivyMD, sqlite3.
It includes 2 main sections: one for daily jobs from my surveyor job, and the other one for daily expenses.
Features:
- you can put your total amount of money, and updates automatically when you add a new amount for a job, or decreases when adding expenses. This way you always know how much money you have.
- sorting by date, amount, alphabetically
- search
- add
- edit
- remove
- average daily, monthly, yearly
- check a specific period for amount earned in jobs or expenses
- bilingual (ro/en - restart required)
- backup to email (need to create app in email account for password)
- reset databases
- manual change the total amount of money

This was a project i did for my daily personal use.
